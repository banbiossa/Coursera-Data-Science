### Variance

Var(x) = E[(x - mu)^2] = E[X^2] - E[x]^2

Flip a coin with probability p
E(x) = p
E(x^2) = p (as 0 is tails and heads is 2)
V(x) = p - p^2 = p(1-p)

#### Sample  variance

s^2 = Sigma(i-1) (x_i - x_bar) / n-1

This is also a random value, that should estimate the original variance  
If you sample enough and get the sample variance, it should center at the varience  

Variance of 10 die rolls should be 2.92. If you do it enough, it will center around 2.92.

Why n-1? That makes it unbiased.

E(x_bar) = mu  
Var(x_bar) = sigma ^ 2 / n

Variance of the sample mean is s = sigma ^ 2 / n  
- The logical estimate is s^2/n
- the logical estimate of the standard error is S/route(n)

Standard distribtion has variance 1. sample of n should have variance 1/route(n)
